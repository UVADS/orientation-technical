# R Badge
![](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/blob/main/content/images/rstudio-token.png)

R is a tool well suited for statistical work with tidy* data. We will treat it as such. R is not the goal of this badge. The goal is to accomplish tasks like solving mathematical problems, data visualization, and data analysis **using** R. In meeting these requirements you will build a proficiency in R, but that is not sufficient. You must continue to use the skill over time to build and maintain the habit.

Prerequisites: GitHub

## Requirements

1. **read** about:
    1. R history, design philosophy and features, this thing "<=" & this thing "%>%", and libraries
    1. base R vs the tidyverse
    2. Random Number Generators, Histograms, and Data Frames
    * **think** of times when these tools are appropriate and when they might not be appropriate, **share** those findings with a member of your cohort.


2. **prepare** your development environment
    1. **download and install** R and RStudio
    3. **confirm** the right R and RStudio version is running (hint: it is up to date? do you have the most recent version?)
    4. **create** a github repo for your work and **link** it to RStudio
    5. **install** these packages: tidyverse

3. **solve** problems 1,2,3 from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). **store** your solution code in your github repo.

4. **use** a random number generator to make histograms of popular probability distributions. **use** the ggplot package. **choose** THREE from the list below and **store** your resulting code in your github repo.
    * Binomial
    * Poisson
    * Normal
    * Uniform
    * Chi Squared

5. **Visually Demonstrate** (use histograms) to show that the Binomial and Normal distributions converge in the large *N* limit. **Store** the resulting histograms in your github repo. **Make** a mini-presentation **using a markdown file** in your github repo explaining the proof.

6. **load** the data from the class hardware survey into memory using the tidyverse, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and **make** exploratory histographs of the features of the dataset. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram **provide** a qualitative description.  **Store** your data in your github repo. (The cohort data is stored [here](https://github.com/UVADS/orientation-technical/tree/main/workshops/dat))

7. **Prepare for presentation** your findings from the class hardware data using a markdown file in your repo. **Share** your mini presentation with another member of your cohort.





## Footnotes
* "tidy" is jargon, it refers to working with data using the tidyverse
