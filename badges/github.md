# GitHub

GitHub is a social media company. Do not be fooled. It is the leading social media outlet used by coders in the Data Science space. The key is to bend the social media to your purpose, not fall victim to its business model. In this badge you will develop fundamental GitHub skills so that you can achieve your career goals. GitHub enables to you **develop and share your code** in a manner that **demonstrates your capabilities to future employers**.



## Requirements

1. **read** about:
   1.  the history of version control software. Learn about the evolution of different VCSs and they evolved in the internet and social media landscape.
   2. the specific history of git and its role in the modern technology landscape.
   3.  the history of GitHub the company, their acquisition by Microsoft, and exploration of AI assissted software development. 
   4.  the history of Free and Open software.

   * **then tell** a friend about what you learned and how they can use the tools in their everyday life even if they are not a programmer. Explain to them why people put code on GitHub. Explain the difference between version control software, git, github, github.com, and one alternative to github.

2. **decide** for yourself if GitHub is version control software or social media. Discuss your answer with another member of your cohort. (Find several sources about the uses of GitHub and understand those use cases.)

3. **go to** a github repository and click on everything. everything!

3. **create** a github account. Remember that this account will present you to the professional world. Seek out and read three sources about how you can use your GitHub profile in a job interview setting. 
 
4. **create** a GitHub repository. This repository will contain materials you gather and learn during this orientation. It will:
     1. Have a README.md file - This file is the welcome page to your repository and serves to orient new arrivals. Find three sources about how to use the README effectively on a GitHub repository. Find three sources about how to use the markdown format effectively. Take what you like and craft your README. You can always edit it later so focus more on form than content.
     2. Have a LICENSE - Read about common licenses used on GitHub. Read the UVA School of Data Science reccomendation on Open Science. Explore why licensing your work is important and explain that significant to another member of the cohort.
     3. Use the browser based editor to modify your files
     4. Share your repository

5. **fork** a repo. make an edit. issue a pull request. Choose from ONE of the following repos:
    1.  https://github.com/alonzi/projectEuler
    2.  https://github.com/alonzi/star_wars_power_rankings

    * *help/hint* For help understanding Collaborative Coding use the resources here: https://github.com/features

5. **read** [Code Review Guidelines for Humans](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/)
    * Commit to ...
      * being humble.
      * asking if someone wants to recieve feedback before giving feedback (Sometimes, people just need you to listen to them).
    * Select one principle from this article and share it with a member of your cohort. Tell them why it resonated with you and what you will do to keep it in your mind.
    * Explore literature about the interaction of human emotions and programming especially when critique is involved. Incorporate these ideas into your conversation with your friend.

7. **read** about higher order features of GitHub. Pick ONE from each category. https://github.com/features
    * go to https://github.com/features and select ONE from
       * Automation and CI/CD
       * Security
    * and ONE from
       * Project Management
       * Team Administration
    * for each be able to summarize what you learned to a friend who knows about GitHub but hasn't explored these features themselves and is curious about them.
 
8. **analyze** three different GitHub repsitories along the axis of documentation. Decide for yourself which repositories have better and worse documentation and what moves you would like to incorporate in your work going forward.

9. **seek** out the GitHub page for THREE faculty members you are interested in meeting. Read the page and develop several questions about the contents the spark your curiousity.

10. **seek** out the GitHub page for THREE alumni of the School of Data Science. Investigate one of their projects and prepare a list of questions you would ask them if the opportunity presents itself.

11. **investigate** the data behind an article you are reading. For an article that you have read that contains a data visualization follow the trail back to where the data came from and how they generated their visualizations. If you find a GitHub page explore it. If not repeat this requirement.
