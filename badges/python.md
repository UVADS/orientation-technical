# Python

Python is a tool well suited to Data Science work. We will treat it as such. Python is not the goal of this badge. The goal is to accomplish tasks like solving mathematical problems, data visualization, and data analysis **using** python. In meeting these requirements you will build a proficiency in python, but that is not sufficient. You must continue to use the skill over time to build and maintain the habit.

Prerequisites: GitHub, VS Code

## Requirements

1. **read** about:
    1. python history, design philosophy and features, indentation, and packages
    1. VS Code extensions
    2. Random Number Generators, Histograms, and Data Frames
    * **think** of times when these tools are appropriate and when they might not be appropriate, **share** those findings with a member of your cohort.


2. **prepare** your development environment
    1. **configure** a new conda environment with any version of python3 you like
    3. **confirm** the right python extension is running in vs code
    4. **create** a github repo for your work and **link** it to vs code
    5. **install** these packages: matplotlib, numpy, pandas
        * ALERT! This can be a tricky step. There are two main programs pip and conda (Professor Kropko prefers pip).
        * ALERT ALERT! Often there are multiple versions of python on a machine. This can lead to mystifying behavior.
        * Do not wait long if you are having trouble on this step. Ask a friend!  

3. **solve** problems 1,2,3 from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). **store** your solution code in your github repo.

4. **use** a random number generator to make histograms of popular probability distributions. **use** the numpy and matplotlib packages. **choose** THREE from the list below and **store** your resulting code in your github repo.
    * Binomial
    * Poisson
    * Normal
    * Uniform
    * Chi Squared

5. **Visually Demonstrate** (use histograms) to show that the Binomial and Normal distributions converge in the large *N* limit. **Store** the resulting histograms in your github repo. **Make** a mini-presentation **using a markdown file** in your github repo explaining the proof.

6. **load** the data from the class hardware survey into memory using pandas, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and **make** exploratory histograms of the features of the dataset. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram **provide** a qualitative description.  **Store** your data in your github repo.

7. **Prepare for presentation** your findings from the class hardware data using a markdown file in your repo. **Share** your mini presentation with another member of your cohort.
