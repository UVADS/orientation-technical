# UVA Data Science Graduate School Technical Orientation
Hello there. Welcome to your one stop shop for technical orientation materials. Regardless of which program you are enrolled in at the School of Data Science for graduate studies this is the place to be. The faculty member responsible for this orientation is Professor Alonzi (lpa2a@virginia.edu). This GitHub page is the starting place and we will direct you to the best resources for enriching your learning. We endeavour, so far as in our power lies, to only use free and open resources but from time to time you may need a resource that is not free and open. When that happens we work with the UVA Library to try and avoid any direct cost to you. Our liason from the UVA Library is Jenn Huck (jah2ax@virginia.edu).
