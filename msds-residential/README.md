## The Checklist
You may complete these items in any order

0. **watch** Jurassic Park ([link to free access via uva library](https://digitalcampus-swankmp-net.proxy1.library.virginia.edu/uva296909/play/bafece83e07de665?referrer=marc))

    * Explain two ethical challenges the characters in the movie face and what you would do in their place.
    * Discuss with a member of your cohort: strategies for identifying ethical challenges in the digital world.

1. **complete** computer hardware survey - [link](https://forms.gle/z5abzLzQNCfxoTPY7)
    
2. **read** [Code Review Guidelines for Humans](https://phauer.com/2018/code-review-guidelines/)

    * Commit to ...
      * being humble.
      * asking if someone wants to recieve feedback before giving feedback (Sometimes, people just need you to listen to them).
    * Select one principle from this article and share it with a member of your cohort. Tell them why it resonated with you and what you will do to keep it in your mind.

3. **Make** your main orientation deliverable

   Our main deliverable is a slideshow that serves as a facebook for our cohort. We will use the data from the computer survey.
   
    * explore the data - [link](https://myuva-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/lpa2a_virginia_edu/EaYgPuweO6ZEp-_ZCOWog_UBKtd5dbV6BP46WCtzbxQTpw?e=Vhcq1g)
    * make a histogram - using the tools you have learned over the orientation make a histogram representing the information contained in our dataset 
    * create your slide in the presentation - [link](https://myuva-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/lpa2a_virginia_edu/EdRujYxJ1zdBhbB4UI9K7kgBy9Lwpyo6rBhPUnW6AN4hCA?e=bLChpY)
       * Your Name
       * A picture of you showing some part of your life/personality that isn't related to data science
       * Your histogram
       * Link to the github repo with the code for making your histogram

7. **call** someone you should call more often and tell them about what you are excited to learn this summer

8. **complete** the following 4 badges:

   You may work on these badges in any order and simultaneously. If you would prefer to go sequentially starting from first principles the recommended order is: GitHub --> VSCode --> Python.

6. Summer Professor's Special Requests. There are items your upcoming professors have asked you to pay particular attention to. (* indicates difficulty)

   Think of this section as a test. When you read this list ask yourself if you are prepared to teach each item to someone.

   * Professor Kropko
      * pip / pip install [***] (python badge)
      * you must test, don't just assume it works (e.g. run import numpy afterwards to see if it is working) [*]
      * Notebooks [*] (jupyter badge)
   * Professor Alvarado
      * The git/github ecosystem and how it relates to files on the cloud and your laptop [**] (github badge)
      * CLI [**] (VSCode badge)
      * Local v Remote [**] (VSCode badge)
      * PATH/working directory (aka Where's my file) [**] (VSCode badge)
      * Clear understanding of the python install [***] (python badge)
      * Notebooks [*] (jupyter badge)
   * Professor Afriyie - The R Badge [*]

## For when you want to kick back and watch some content
* This playlist will help you to get to know Professor Alonzi and computer hardware better. It is a little dated, but still relevant. This falls sqarely in what we call systems.
