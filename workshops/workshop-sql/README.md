# SQL Workshop
**Executive Summary** This document contains the materials for the UVADS workshop on SQL by Professor Alonzi. 

## Outline
2. Introduction
3. Preamble
4. The Data Scientist Minimum for SQL
5. Your first SQL project


## Introduction
1. `whois` lpa2a
2. Goals for today
    * Define and Motivate SQL
    * Prt I: Present the Data Scientist Minimum
    * Part II: Make individual plans for building SQL proficiency
    * _Secret goal: But really, I just want you to ask questions_


## Preamble
![](sql-meme.png)

**You have to have some moves. But you really need to be able to talk to the nerd in the corder.**

# Part I - The Data Scientist Minimum
## What is SQL?
SQL = **S**tructured-**Q**uery-**L**anguage

pronounced S-Q-L; less commonly "sequel"; now, sometimes "squirrel" [citation needed]

## OK but what ... **is** ... SQL?

The language you use to get data out of a relationtional database (RDB)

## OK but what ... **is** ... RDB?

Let's just take a look.
1. Whiteboard
2. On your computers

## Why HPC?
1. Set it and forget it (jobs run in batch mode) --> I don't need to leave my laptop open
2. Run many jobs at the same time --> I don't need to buy a thousan laptops
3. The need for speed --> I don't need to buy an expensive fancy laptop

## Exercise
![](deer.jpg)[6]
1. Logon to rivanna
2. Submit a batch job of "hello world", have the computer say its name
3. Submit 100 batch jobs of "hello world", have the computers say their name

**Hint: Documentation [here](https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/rivanna/slurm/) and [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)**

**Hint: use `allocations` to find an allocation**

## Exercise
1. Logon to rivanna
2. Upload some code you have already written
3. Submit a batch job to run the code

# Part II
**Objective: Create an individual plan for you to practice your HPC skills**

This part is just an exercise. Individually you will explore your github account for a project that you can scale up with HPC. Then you will make a plan for scaling it up. At the end you will leave with a new github repository and a set to tasks to accomplish to put your new HPC knowledge into practice. By working this plan over time you will build proficiency with HPC.

# Wrap up
1. Please think of one thing you liked and one thing you would change about this workshop. And a few sentences about why.
2. Then make a pull request and add them to this repo in the folder workshop-gnu-linux/feedback.
