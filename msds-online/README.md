## For when you want to kick back and watch some content
* This playlist will help you to get to know Professor Alonzi and computer hardware better. It is a little dated, but still relevant. This falls sqarely in what we call systems. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1ZfpZ3HSwI&list=TLGGK2JILVWuD64yNjA2MjAyMw&index=1))
* These videos give a flavour of the other aspects of data science:
    * Design: [How we can find ourselves in data | Giorgia Lupi](https://youtu.be/sFIDCtRX_-o?si=mpxzo5iAFyffZBvZ)
    * Value: [Why all world maps are wrong](https://youtu.be/kIID5FDi2JQ?si=UBsgDagRsTQRUthY)
    * Analytics: [Bayes theorem, the geometry of changing beliefs](https://youtu.be/HZGCoVF3YvM?si=fPJqN6UEYERaNjRG)
* The UVA Data Science YouTube Channel also has great videos! ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0t9SVI4We4))
